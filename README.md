# SpaceGame
My first game using LibGDX.
This project is now finally over. Although quite a few bits need to be polished i have decided to move on to a more ambitious project.
The game is open source, so if you would like to use it for your own learning or modify it feel free to do that.

If you have trouble the main issue is likely to be images not loading. 
In order to fix that:
1. The compiled jar file should be opened with winrar to check if the assets folder is in the root directory.
2. If it is not then drag and drop it in there.
